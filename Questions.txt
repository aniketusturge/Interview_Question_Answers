One of your nodes is NotReady for more than 10 minutes. How would you troubleshoot and fix it?

You notice pods are stuck in Pending even though there are available nodes. What steps do you take?

CPU usage on a node is consistently high, but HPA isn’t scaling pods. How do you debug?

How do you drain a node for maintenance without causing downtime in production?

Pod & Deployment Issues


You deployed a new version of an application, but traffic is still routed to old pods. What might be wrong?

A Deployment keeps creating pods, but they get OOMKilled. How do you troubleshoot?

If a pod is consuming too much memory/CPU and affecting others, how would you enforce limits?

Networking & Services

A pod cannot reach an external service (like a DB or API). How do you debug connectivity?

A Service of type ClusterIP isn’t reachable from another namespace. How do you fix it?

You exposed a Service with LoadBalancer, but it’s not accessible from the internet. What do you check?

How do you debug DNS resolution failures inside a pod?

Storage & Data

A pod using a PVC is stuck in Pending because PV is not bound. How do you resolve it?

Your PVC is full. How do you expand storage without downtime?

What happens if a StatefulSet pod with a PVC gets deleted? How do you recover data?

Scaling & Performance

HPA scales pods up, but performance is still poor. What else would you check?

VPA suggests scaling down pods, but workloads crash after applying. How do you handle it?

How would you autoscale not just pods, but also nodes in the cluster?

Security & RBAC

A developer reports they cannot access a namespace they should have access to. How do you debug RBAC issues?

How do you prevent containers from running as root in the cluster?

How would you secure secrets in Kubernetes, beyond plain Secrets?

Monitoring & Troubleshooting

Your application response time is very high, but CPU/memory look fine. How do you debug in Kubernetes?

How do you monitor and alert on pod restarts?

How do you collect logs from all pods and centralize them for analysis?

Disaster Recovery & Upgrades

How would you recover a cluster if the etcd database gets corrupted?

You upgraded Kubernetes from v1.26 to v1.28 and some workloads broke. How do you roll back safely?

How do you handle a situation where an entire Availability Zone goes down in an EKS/GKE/AKS cluster?
