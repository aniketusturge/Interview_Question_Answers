Q. How do you handle a disk full issue in Linux?

"If I get a disk full issue in Linux in production, I handle it with a structured troubleshooting approach to quickly free up space while minimizing downtime:

1️⃣ Identify the Full Filesystem
Run:
df -h
to check which filesystem/partition is full (e.g., /, /var, /tmp, /home).
If inode exhaustion (not space):
df -I

2️⃣ Find Large Files & Directories
To locate big consumers of disk space:

du -sh /* | sort -h
du -sh /var/* | sort -h

To find large files quickly:
find / -xdev -type f -size +500M

3️⃣ Check for Logs & Rotations
In production, /var/log often fills up.
I check:
ls -lh /var/log
If a log is huge (e.g., messages, app.log), I rotate/truncate:
> /var/log/app.log    # truncate safely

(or use logrotate for automation).

4️⃣ Remove Orphaned Files
Sometimes space is consumed by deleted files still held by processes.
Check with:
lsof | grep deleted
Kill/restart the process to release space.

5️⃣ Clean Temporary & Cache Files
Clear package caches:
yum clean all    # RHEL/CentOS
apt-get clean    # Ubuntu/Debian

Remove temporary files:
rm -rf /tmp/*

6️⃣ Archive or Move Data
For old logs/backups, compress and move to S3/NFS:
tar -czf old-logs.tar.gz /var/log/old/
mv old-logs.tar.gz /mnt/backup/

7️⃣ Resize or Extend Disk (Long-Term Fix)
If space usage is legitimate (DB growth, app data), I:
Add a new disk and mount it.
Or extend existing LVM volume:
lvextend -L +20G /dev/vg0/lv_root
resize2fs /dev/vg0/lv_root
Update /etc/fstab to ensure persistence.

8️⃣ Monitoring & Prevention
Set up alerts in Prometheus/Grafana, CloudWatch, or Nagios to trigger at 70–80% disk usage.
Automate log rotation & cleanup with cron jobs or Ansible.

✅ Key Interview Points:
-Identify full partition → df -h.
-Find large files → du, find.
-Check logs, temp, caches → clean safely.
-Handle deleted-but-open files via lsof.
-Resize disk (LVM/Cloud) if needed.
-Always set up monitoring & preventive measures.
